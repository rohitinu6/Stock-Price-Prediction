### 3. Explore Contribution Areas
Here are some areas where you can contribute:

#### üîç **Data Exploration and Feature Engineering**
- Analyze stock price trends and extract new features that could improve model performance (e.g., technical indicators like RSI or Moving Averages).
- Clean and preprocess additional financial datasets to enhance prediction accuracy.

#### ü§ñ **Model Development**
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms or fine-tune the existing ones like **AdaBoost**, **LSTM**, etc.
- Try implementing **Ensemble methods** or newer techniques such as **AutoML**.

#### üìä **Performance Analysis**
- Evaluate models using more detailed metrics or visualizations (e.g., precision-recall curves, ROC curves).
- Compare performance across different time intervals (e.g., weekly vs. monthly data).

#### üß† **Deep Learning Integration**
- Integrate deep learning models like **CNNs** or hybrid approaches combining **ANN** with financial sentiment data.

### 4. Submitting Your Contribution
1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name
   ```
2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive message about your contribution"
   ```
3. Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch-name
   ```
4. Create a pull request (PR) to the original repository from your GitHub fork.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Guidelines
- **Write clean, readable code** with proper comments and documentation.
- **Follow PEP8 standards** for Python code.
- **Ensure your code runs smoothly** by testing it with real data from the `notebooks/` or `src/` directories.

### Testing Your Changes
Before submitting your PR, make sure to test your code:
- Run the notebooks to ensure your models are working as expected.
- Validate the performance with accuracy, RMSE, MAE, and other relevant metrics.
  
## üìù Documentation
If you're introducing new algorithms or modifying existing ones, please update the documentation. This can include:
- Adding new markdown cells in Jupyter notebooks.
- Updating README files or adding comments in the code.

## üåü Looking for Inspiration?
- Add **sentiment analysis** or **news-based prediction** to correlate stock prices with market sentiment.
- Build a **live stock price prediction dashboard** using real-time data from Yahoo Finance API.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Community
Join the discussion in the [Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) section! Share your ideas, ask questions, and collaborate on exciting features with fellow contributors.

## üîÑ Recent Updates

### Changes in Flask Route for Stock Prediction:
- The route `/predict_close` has been updated to handle both `GET` and `POST` requests.
  - **GET** request: Renders the `stock.html` form when the user navigates to the prediction page.
  - **POST** request: Processes the stock price prediction based on user input (Open, High, Low, and Volume).
  
Make sure to follow the updated code structure when adding new routes for similar tasks. The current structure is as follows:

```python
@app.route('/predict_close', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def predict_close():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        try:
            inputs = [
                float(request.form.get('Open')),
                float(request.form.get('High')),
                float(request.form.get('Low')),
                float(request.form.get('Volume'))
            ]

            close_prediction = stock_model.predict(np.array([inputs]))[0] if stock_model else None

            save_data(inputs, close_prediction)
            retrain_model()

            return str(round(close_prediction, 2)) if close_prediction is not None else "Error: Stock model not loaded."
        except Exception as e:
            return f"An error occurred: {e}"
    # For GET request, render the stock.html page
    return render_template('stock.html')


## üéâ Thank You!
