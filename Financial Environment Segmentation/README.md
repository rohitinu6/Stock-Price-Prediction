## 📖 Overview
The **Financial Environment Segmentation** project focuses on identifying and classifying different market regimes using historical stock price data. This approach aids in understanding market dynamics, helping traders and investors make informed decisions.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Recognizing distinct market regimes (bull, bear, neutral) is vital for effective investment strategies. Variability in market conditions necessitates a robust framework to identify and respond to these changes promptly.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
This project employs clustering techniques to segment financial environments, providing insights into market behavior based on historical data.

| Key Components        | Description                                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Collection       | Historical stock price data gathered from Yahoo Finance.        |
| Data Preprocessing    | Calculation of daily returns, moving averages, and volatility.   |
| Feature Engineering    | Normalization and selection of relevant features for analysis.   |
| Clustering            | K-means clustering to classify market regimes.                   |
| Analysis & Validation | Evaluation of regimes and their characteristics through backtesting. |

| Library        | Purpose                                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| pandas         | Data manipulation and analysis            |
| numpy          | Numerical computing                        |
| matplotlib     | Data visualization                        |
| scikit-learn   | Machine learning algorithms               |
| yfinance       | Financial data retrieval                  |

## ⚙️ Alternatives Considered
Several alternative approaches were evaluated for market regime detection:

| Alternative Approach            | Description                                                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Traditional Machine Learning     | Techniques like SVM and k-NN; effective for smaller datasets.      |
| Advanced Clustering Algorithms   | Exploring DBSCAN and Hierarchical Clustering for better segmentation.|

## 📊 Results
The model aims to achieve accurate segmentation of market regimes, facilitating better investment strategies and risk management.

## 🔍 Conclusion
The project demonstrates the importance of identifying financial market regimes, showcasing how clustering techniques can provide valuable insights for traders and investors.
