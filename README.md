| 🤖 Algorithm                              | 📜 Description                                      |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression                        | A basic regression algorithm.                       |
| Support Vector Regression (SVR)         | Effective for non-linear relationships.             |
| Random Forest                            | Ensemble learning method using decision trees.      |
| Gradient Boosting Models (GBM)          | Sequentially builds models to improve predictions.  |
| Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)     | Advanced boosting technique with regularization.    |
| AdaBoostRegressor                        | Combines multiple weak learners.                    |
| Decision Tree                            | Simple yet effective model based on tree structure. |
| KNeighborsRegressor (KNN)               | Predicts based on nearest neighbors' average.      |
| Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)        | Mimics human brain for complex data patterns.       |
| Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)           | Suitable for time-series prediction.                |

## 🔮 Future Work

- Combine this data with stock sentiment data to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Utilize clustering algorithms to develop a buy/sell recommendation system.

## 🏆 Conclusion

Among the models assessed, **AdaBoostRegressor** and **LSTM** emerged as the top performers, showcasing low RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values. These metrics suggest that these algorithms effectively capture the underlying trends and patterns in the stock price data, making them reliable for prediction tasks.

While some models demonstrated solid predictive capabilities, others, such as **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** and **KNeighborsRegressor**, recorded higher RMSE and MAE values. This indicates that these algorithms may yield acceptable predictions on average but are susceptible to significant errors in certain scenarios, emphasizing the need for careful model selection for stock price predictions.
