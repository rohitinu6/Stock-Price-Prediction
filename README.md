## Future Work

- We can further combine this data with that of stock sentiment data in order to achieve even better conclusion
- Also we can possibly use Clustering algorithms to develop a buy/sell recommendation system

## Conclusion

- Among the models assessed, AdaBoostRegressor and LSTM emerged as the top performers, showcasing low RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values. These metrics suggest that these algorithms effectively capture the underlying trends and patterns in the stock price data, making them reliable for prediction tasks.
- While some models demonstrated solid predictive capabilities, others, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) and KNeighborsRegressor, recorded higher RMSE and MAE values. This suggests that these algorithms may produce acceptable predictions on average but are susceptible to significant errors in certain scenarios. Consequently, their reliability in real-world applications could be compromised, highlighting the need for careful consideration when selecting models for stock price predictions.
